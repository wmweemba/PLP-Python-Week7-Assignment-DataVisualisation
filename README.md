# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Python notebook (`Iris_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb`) that explores and analyzes the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, consisting of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

The notebook performs the following key tasks:

* **Data Loading:** Loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file using the pandas library.
* **Data Exploration:**
    * Examines the structure of the dataset, including data types and missing values.
    * Computes basic descriptive statistics for the numerical features (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
* **Data Cleaning:**
    * Handles missing values (if any) by filling them with appropriate values or dropping the rows.
* **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
    * Groups the data by species and calculates the mean of the numerical features for each species.
    * Creates various visualizations using Matplotlib to explore the data:
        * Line chart (Petal Length vs. Petal Width)
        * Bar chart (Average Petal Length by Species)
        * Histogram (Distribution of Petal Length)
        * Scatter plot (Sepal Length vs. Petal Length)
* **Findings:**
    * Identifies patterns and interesting relationships between the features and the Iris species.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **matplotlib:** For creating visualizations.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib


It is assumed that you have a working installation of Python and a suitable environment to run Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., Anaconda).
Dataset
The Iris dataset is included in this repository as a CSV file (iris.csv). The dataset contains the following columns:
sepal_length: Sepal length in centimeters (cm)
sepal_width: Sepal width in centimeters (cm)
petal_length: Petal length in centimeters (cm)
petal_width: Petal width in centimeters (cm)
species: The species of the Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
How to Run the Notebook
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>


Navigate to the directory containing the notebook and the data.
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook


Open the Iris_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb notebook.
Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
Key Findings
The analysis reveals the following key findings:
Petal length and petal width are the most important features to differentiate between the three Iris species.
Iris setosa has smaller petal dimensions compared to the other two species.
Iris virginica has the largest petal dimensions.
Sepal length also varies across species, but to a lesser extent than petal dimensions.
Sepal width shows the least amount of variation between the species.
These findings suggest that petal measurements are crucial for understanding and potentially predicting the species of an Iris flower.
Visualizations
The following visualizations are generated in the notebook:
Petal Length vs. Petal Width (Line Chart): This chart shows the relationship between petal length and petal width. While not a traditional time-series, it illustrates how petal width changes as petal length increases.
Average Petal Length by Species (Bar Chart): This chart compares the average petal length for each of the three Iris species. It clearly shows the differences in petal size across species.
Distribution of Petal Length (Histogram): This histogram visualizes the frequency distribution of petal length, showing the range of petal lengths and how common different lengths are.
Sepal Length vs. Petal Length (Scatter Plot): This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between sepal length and petal length, helping to identify any potential correlation between these two features.
